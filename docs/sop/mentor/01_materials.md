## Sylabus

The sylabus is a structured outline of the topics, objectives, and materials that will be covered during the Time Series Analysis project. It serves as a roadmap for both mentors and mentees to ensure that all necessary content is addressed in a systematic manner.

### What to Include in the Sylabus

The sylabus will include:

- A list of topics to be covered
- Learning objectives and milestones
- Recommended resources and reading materials
- A schedule for sessions and activities
- Example questions, case studies, or practice assignments (these will be provided separately)

### What not to Include in the Sylabus

The sylabus should not include:

- Detailed materials for each topic (the mentees are expected to research and find these from the provided resources or other credible sources)

### Structure of the Sylabus

The sylabus is located in the `docs/sylabus` directory. The structure of the directory is as follows:
