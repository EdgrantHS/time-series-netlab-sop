# Topic 1: Python Notebooks Setup

Python notebooks (.ipynb) are interactive environments for code execution. They are mainly used instead of traditional scripts (.py files) because they allow for running code in small chunks (cells) and immediately seeing the results, which is particularly useful for data exploration and visualization. This topic covers setting up Python notebooks in VS Code and Google Colab.

## Expected Knowledge

After this sub module, the student should be able to explain the following concepts:

- Python notebook environment and interface
- Cells (code, markdown)
- What is a kernel and virtual environments
- VS Code notebook or Google Colab environment

## Learning Resources

You are encouraged to explore resources beyond those listed here. You can also choose to use different resources based on your learning preferences.

### Python Notebooks

- Highly Recommended: [Python for Data Science - Cognitive Class](https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/python-for-data-science)
- Recommended: [Python Notebooks in VS Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DA6ZAHBPF1U)
- Optional: [Getting Started with Google Colab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inN8seMm7UI)

### Kernels and Virtual Environments

- [Python Installation for Windows](https://youtu.be/TNAu6DvB9Ng?si=cV-NjA3YsUMC8MSg)
  - It is suggested to install Python 3.12 because many libraries used in data science are compatible with this version.
- Optional: [Python virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

### Deep Neural Network

- Optional Deep Dive: [Deep Neural Network](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkDaE6sCZn6Hn0vK8co82zjQtt3T2Nkqc) This video playlist is optional and covers more advanced topics in deep learning. It provides insights and intuition on how to improve neural networks.

## Case Study: Setting Up ML Development Environment

### Task Requirements

**VS Code Setup:**

1. Install VS Code with Python and Jupyter extensions
2. Set up Python interpreter
3. Create a new python notebook

**Google Colab Setup:**

1. Create new Google Colab notebook
3. Understand runtime management and GPU/TPU access

**Template Creation (both platforms):**

1. Create a project template notebook with:
   - Project documentation section (markdown)
   - Environment setup and library imports (code cell)
   - User input section (code cell)
   - Print the user input (code cell)

### Expected Deliverables

- Working Python notebook environment in VS Code or functional Google Colab setup

## Assessment Criteria

Students should demonstrate:

- [ ] Successful setup of Python notebooks in either VS Code or Google Colab
- [ ] Ability to create and manage different cell types effectively
- [ ] Proper use of markdown for documentation in notebooks
- [ ] Understanding of when to use VS Code vs Google Colab for different scenarios
