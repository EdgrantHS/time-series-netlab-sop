## Learning Resources

You are encouraged to explore resources beyond those listed here. You can also choose to use different resources based on your learning preferences.

### Core ML Concepts

- Highly Recommended: [Machine Learning with Python - Cognitive Class (Module 1)](https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/machine-learning-with-python). This course is a little long but it is highly recommended as it covers many foundational concepts in ML and provides practical coding examples. Module 5 isn't required for this topic but you can explore it if you want.
