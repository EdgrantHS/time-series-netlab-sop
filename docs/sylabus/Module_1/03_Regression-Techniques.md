- What is regression analysis
- What is the difference between linear and polynomial regression
- What is regression regularization
- Model evaluation metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, R²)

## Learning Resources

You are encouraged to explore resources beyond those listed here. You can also choose to use different resources based on your learning preferences.

### Regression Fundamentals

- Highly Recommended: [Machine Learning with Python - Cognitive Class (Module 2)](https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/machine-learning-with-python). This course is a little long but it is highly recommended as it covers many foundational concepts in ML and provides practical coding examples.
- Recommended: [Linear Regression Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2CQITm_eo)
- Optional: [Regularization in Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q81RR3yKn30)

## Assessment Criteria

Students should demonstrate:
- [ ] Proper implementation of linear and polynomial regression
- [ ] Correct application of evaluation metrics
