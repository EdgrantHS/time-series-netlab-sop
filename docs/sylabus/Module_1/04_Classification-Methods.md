- Confusion matrix interpretation and ROC curves

## Learning Resources

You are encouraged to explore resources beyond those listed here. You can also choose to use different resources based on your learning preferences.

### Classification Fundamentals

- Highly Recommended: [Machine Learning with Python - Cognitive Class (Module 3)](https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/machine-learning-with-python). This course is a little long but it is highly recommended as it covers many foundational concepts in ML and provides practical coding examples.
- Recommended: [Classification Algorithms Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtRLrQ3Ev-U)
- Optional: [Logistic Regression vs Linear Regression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIYKR4sgzI8)

## Assessment Criteria

Students should demonstrate:
- [ ] Proper implementation of multiple classification algorithms
- [ ] Understanding of classification evaluation metrics and their trade-offs
