## Expected Knowledge

After this sub module, the student should be able to explain the following concepts:

- Unsupervised learning and clustering objectives
- K-means algorithm and centroid-based clustering
- DBSCAN and density-based clustering
- Clustering evaluation metrics (silhouette score, inertia)

## Learning Resources

You are encouraged to explore resources beyond those listed here. You can also choose to use different resources based on your learning preferences.

### Clustering Fundamentals

- Highly Recommended: [Machine Learning with Python - Cognitive Class (Module 4)](https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/machine-learning-with-python). This course is a little long but it is highly recommended as it covers many foundational concepts in ML and provides practical coding examples.
- Recommended: [Clustering Algorithms Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXOkPvFM6NU)
- Optional: [K-means vs Hierarchical Clustering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xHsRkOdVwo)

## Assessment Criteria

Students should demonstrate:
- [ ] Proper implementation of multiple clustering algorithms
- [ ] Understanding of cluster evaluation metrics and validation techniques
- [ ] Ability to determine optimal number of clusters
- [ ] Knowledge of when to use different clustering methods
