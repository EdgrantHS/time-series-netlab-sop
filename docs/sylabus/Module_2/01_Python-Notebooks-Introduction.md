# Topic 1: Python Notebooks Introduction

Python notebooks (Jupyter notebooks) are interactive environments for code execution. It is mainly used insted of traditional scripts (.py files) because they allow for running code in small chunks (cells) and immediately seeing the results, which is particularly useful for data exploration and visualization.

## Case Study: Setting Up Your First Time Series Analysis Environment

### Scenario
You are a data analyst who has just joined a team working on stock price prediction. Your first task is to set up a Jupyter notebook environment and create a template notebook that the team can use for future time series analysis projects.

### Task Requirements
1. Install Jupyter Notebook and required libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
2. Create a new notebook with the following structure:
   - Title and introduction (markdown cell)
   - Import statements for common libraries (code cell)
   - Data loading template (code cell with comments)
   - Basic visualization template (code cell)
   - Analysis summary template (markdown cell)

### Expected Deliverables
- A working Jupyter notebook environment
- A template notebook with proper markdown documentation

## Assessment Criteria

Students should demonstrate:
- [ ] Successful installation and launch of Jupyter Notebook
- [ ] Ability to create and execute different cell types
- [ ] Understanding of keyboard shortcuts for efficient workflow
- [ ] Proper use of markdown for documentation
- [ ] Organization of code and analysis in a logical structure
