## Module Overview

Each module focuses on a specific aspect of time series analysis or machine learning in general.

### Module 1: Data Exploration and Visualization

This module covers the basics of data exploration and visualization techniques that are essential for understanding time series data. Topics include:

- Decomposing trends and seasonality
- Autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation
- Stationarity and differencing
- Correlation and covariance
- Data visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)
